A repository for 

- updating our ancient programming skills to be useful for coding in python (3.7)
- discovering the most awkward books in python's library
- learning to deal with pycharm (2020.2)
- scratching our pentesting itches
- shaking down django (3.1.2) and PostgreSQL by creating a dashboard for some pentesting scripts
- grokking git and github and tracking each others blundering about with a grin on our faces
