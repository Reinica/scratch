A repository for 

- updating our ancient programming skills to be useful for coding in python
- discovering the most awkward books in python's library
- learning to deal with pycharm
- scratching our pentesting itches
- shaking down django and other web development by creating a dashboard for some pentesting scripts made from scratch
- grokking git and github and tracking each others blundering about with a grin on our faces
